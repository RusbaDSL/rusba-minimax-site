# üîß **Supabase Migration Instructions**

## üö® **Root Cause Identified**

The product update timeout issue is caused by **missing RLS (Row Level Security) policies** in Supabase. The products table only allows SELECT operations but blocks INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Run the Supabase Migration**

### **Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor**

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `yrjmnvnxczritqyrxmgo`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Query"**

### **Step 2: Run the Migration Script**

Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-migration-fix.sql` into the SQL editor and click **"Run"**.

### **Step 3: Verify the Migration**

The migration will show:
- ‚úÖ All products RLS policies are in place!
- Products table now has 4 RLS policies

### **Step 4: Test Admin Functionality**

1. **Sign up** as a new user on your site
2. **Run this SQL** to make yourself admin:
   ```sql
   SELECT make_user_admin('your-email@example.com');
   ```
3. **Try the admin dashboard** - product updates should work instantly!

## üîê **What the Fix Does**

### **Missing RLS Policies (Before)**
```sql
-- Only allowed SELECT operations
CREATE POLICY "Products are viewable by everyone" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);
-- No INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE policies = Access Denied!
```

### **Fixed RLS Policies (After)**
```sql
-- Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Products are viewable by everyone" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Admin INSERT permission
CREATE POLICY "Admins can insert products" ON products FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND user_profiles.is_admin = true
  )
);

-- Admin UPDATE permission  
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update products" ON products FOR UPDATE USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND user_profiles.is_admin = true
  )
);

-- Admin DELETE permission
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete products" ON products FOR DELETE USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND user_profiles.is_admin = true
  )
);
```

## üéØ **Expected Results After Migration**

- ‚úÖ **No more timeouts** - Product updates complete instantly
- ‚úÖ **Admin authentication** - Only admin users can modify products
- ‚úÖ **Public product viewing** - Everyone can browse products
- ‚úÖ **Proper error handling** - Clear permission denied messages
- ‚úÖ **Full CRUD operations** - Add, edit, delete products seamlessly

## üö® **If Migration Fails**

The system has a **fallback to local storage** that ensures the admin dashboard always works, even if Supabase is misconfigured.

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues with the migration, the local storage fallback ensures your admin dashboard remains functional while you troubleshoot the Supabase setup.
